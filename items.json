      "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1n6pbsa/qbr_not_bad_at_the_right_level/",
      "summary": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I've been noticing a lot of people on this sub shrugging off QBR as a horrible metric for evaluating QBs. </p> <p><strong>My take is that QBR is good when looked at as a season-long metric, starting at about the mid-point of the season, and is useful, albeit noisier, as a game-level metric</strong> <strong><em>especially</em></strong> <strong>early in the season.</strong></p> <p>The arguments that I tend to see against QBR tend to go along two lines of thought:</p> <p><strong>1. It's a proprietary ESPN metric, therefore we don't know how it works and therefore we can't trust it</strong></p> <p>While the specifics of the algorithm are proprietary, ESPN has made the overall framework of the approach available. </p> <p>I think the best analogy can be made looking at passer rating: with passer rating, we know that the formula is: 100 x ((CMP/ATT - 0.3) x 5 +(YDS/ATT - 3) x 0.25 + (TD/ATT) x 20 + 2.375 - (INT/ATT x 25))/6</p> <p>What ESPN has made available for QBR is the equivalent of the equation above, but taking the numbers out - i.e., we know what the general calculation looks like, but we don't know the specific weights that are given to individual components.</p> <p>QBR is at its core an EPA per play metric. That means every play gets evaluated based on whether the expected points scored from that position are better or worse after vs. before the play. That EPA metric then gets adjusted for some things (e.g., exlcude garbage time, YAC, strength of opponent based on allowed EPA per play) to get a final answer. Again - we know the core of the approach, we don't know the specifics of how those things are weighted/tuned/filtered/etc. </p> <p>Now, some people think the reason it's proprietary is so that ESPN can tweak it to fit their narratives or other such nefarious purposes. I think that's nonsense, but you're absolutely entitlted to that opinion - I am not going to try to convince you otherwise because at that point we're talking conspiracy theories, and I have zero interest in trying to disprove someone's conspiracy theory.</p> <p><strong>2. It can give unintuitive (aka &quot;wrong&quot;) numbers sometimes, so it's trash.</strong></p> <p>I generally see three things that make the results seem unintuitive:</p> <p><strong>1. Adjusting for strength of opponent is hard:</strong> We have very limited data to adjust for strength of opponent, because the college football season is short, and has a LOT of teams. Even the NFL - which also has a short season - at least gets a much higher percentage of all possible matchups covered. That means that we should expect that <em>any</em> metric that tries to capture for strength of opponent will be subject to noise - i.e., will have some teams that due to outlier performances, plays or games, will look like they are either much stronger or much weaker than they really are. This will be even more pronounced early in the season, when the sample size is even smaller. However, on average, these opponent adjustments are good most of the time. So as you start comparing the performance of a QB against more opponents, then those effects generally start tuning each other out.</p> <p><strong>2. The difference between EPA vs. actual points:</strong> EPA looks at the impact that a play had on your odds of scoring. Because of that, one of the biggest discrepanices you will see between the box score/passer rating and EPA are going to be in non-scoring, high EPA plays. </p> <p>Say a QB throws a 50 yard completion on 3rd and 15 and the receiver gets tackled at the 1 yardline. On the next play, the RB gets the carry and scores. In a traditional box score/passer rating view, the QB is credited with 30 yards and a completion, and 0 points. In an EPA framework, the QB would get credited with a very positive EPA play - because the pre-snap EP would have been low (almost 0), but the post play EP would be almost 7.</p> <p><strong>3. The impact of YAC:</strong> this one requires doing a bit more digging to find out, but QBR tries to take out the impact of YAC. That means that a pass that goes 10 yards in the air and turns into a 75 yard TD because of 65 yards of YAC is not going to get credit for the full impact of the play. Mind you - I can totally see how someone can argue that this could be improved upon, but it's just an assumption made for a model. You could give them the credit for the full play - and then you'd land on the other end of the spectrum where you'd have some dink and dunk QBs with elite YAC WRs that would make them look like stars.</p> <p>So, back to my original claim: if you look at QBR over the entire season, starting about halfway through the season once you've gotten through most of the OOC schedule and gotten at least a couple of conference games, then QBR as a metric is generally going to track well with overall QB performance. Is it perfect? No, there will absolutely be limitations. Generally speaking, where I think QBR struggles is when you're trying to evaluate QBs in elite teams going up against really bad teams or really good teams.</p> <p>Like last year - When you look at Cam Ward's season-long QBR, you see exactly what you'd expect - 88 QBR, highest in the league. </p> <p>But when you look at individual games, you'll see some stuff that's not intuitive. For example, vs. Ball State he goes 19/28 for 346, 5 TDs, 0 INTs, no sacks. That's a 230 passer rating. Like, by all accounts a perfect game. But he had a QBR of 90.</p> <p>By comparison, a 24/34 for 404/3/1 vs. USF had a higher QBR of 93.</p> <p>Now, that feels unintuitive - and the reason is likely the opponent adjustment. Ball State won 3 games last season, and got lit up alot, e.g., 63-7 by James Madison. What that means is that to get a good opponent-adjusted number, you need to go above and beyond what other teams have been able to do against them. But if their defense is so bad that literally <em>everyone</em> is dropping 300 yards and 3 TDs on them, then it becomes <em>really</em> hard for a QB to crank their production up high enough to make that look good <em>relative</em> to the average performance. </p> <p>The same tends to be true when going up against an <em>elite</em> defense. Like, for example: Blake Horvath vs. Notre Dame last year went 7/13 for 88/0/1, 14 carries for 129 and 1 TD. That had a QBR of 96. Why? Because Notre Dame dame had the 2nd best defense in college football, so a LOT of QBs had <em>really</em> bad days against them. Which means sometimes if you can just land one huge play against them, you will immediately do much, much better than everyone else. In the case of Horvath, I'm assuming this was likely lifted by his 47 yard TD run and his 60 yard TD that got Navy into field goal range (that they then missed). </p> <p>Now, again - within the scope of the season, that's negligible - The difference between a QBR of 90 and 100 (or 80) in one game would represent a difference of less than one point in the season-long score. And since most teams aren't going to face just a bunch of super shitty defenses or a bunch of super elite defenses - and yet most QBs are going to face some of them - this noise will kinda tune itself out across QBs, across the season. </p> <p>When you look at QBR at a game level for &quot;normal&quot; games - think of games against opponents with generally similar level of skill with reasonable scores - then it tends to do a fairly good job at capturing performance even if it might sometimes feel unintuitive.</p> <p>An example of an unintuitive, but I think actually fair QBR: Cam Ward last year vs. Georgia Tech:</p> <p>25/39 for 348, 3 TDs, 0 INTs, 3 sacks and a fumble for a 58 passer rating. Seems unintuitively low. But there's a couple of factors at play here:</p> <ol> <li>You will notice that of all the P4 opponents that Georgia Tech played, Miami put up the 3rd least points behind only FSU and Duke. So QBs in general did really well against GT:</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Kyle McCord went for 381 and 4/0. </li> <li>Tyler Sough went for 269 and 2/0 on only 19 passes (QBR favors efficiency over gross numbers)</li> <li>Jacoby Criswell went for 209 and 1/0 passing + 73 rushing with 2 TDs.</li> </ul> <p>So, as with the Ball State case - the baseline for an average performance was high.</p> <ol> <li><p>One of Ward's TDs came on a 75 yard TD that was almost all YAC, and so while that makes his box score look <em>much</em> better, his QBR won't track directly with that.</p></li> <li><p>Ward had a very costly lost fumble to close the game, and had a sack and two incompletions on three different turnovers on downs, all of which were technically inside field goal range (although one would have been a 57 yarder, so that's pushing it for college). Those are going to be heavily penalized plays because the EP of 4th down in field goal range is going to be close to 3 points, so failing to convert a 4th down attempt will carry an approx. -3 EPA, which is pretty bad. </p></li> </ol> <p>Now, you can argue as to whether or not that's fair - and again, that's my point about QBR: at a game-level, it's useful. Even if it's unintuitive, a lot of times you might actually catch something insightful about the QB's performance during that game that goes beyond the scoreboard. I wouldn't die on the hill of QBR being an unquestionable metric at a game level, but it's a data point that is worth looking at in conjuction with other information.</p> <p>The hill I <em>will</em> die on is the idea that any other ubersimplistic way of evaluating QBs is better, including but not limited to:</p> <ol> <li><p>&quot;Did you even watch the game&quot;/&quot;trust me bro&quot;/&quot;you just don't know ball&quot; takes</p></li> <li><p>Passer rating/box score alone</p></li> <li><p>Passer rating/box score limited to some arbitrary subset of opponents (P4, top 25, etc).</p></li> </ol> <p>Now, to be clear - all of those are actually perfectly valid ways of looking at a QB - but they are on par with QBR*. They have some strengths, some weaknesses, some blind spots. I think they are all used best when looked at jointly - but again, that requires a lot more analysis than what people are willing to go through.</p> <p>(*The only exception to me is if we're talking about someone who has a proven track record of evaluating players in a scouting/coaching role. That type of person can get absolutely get a pass over metrics/the opinions of randos on the internet)</p> <p>To me, QBR is a much better starting point statistic from which you can adjust up/down based on additional context than... well, basically anything else we have available.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dfphd\"> /u/dfphd </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1n6pbsa/qbr_not_bad_at_the_right_level/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1n6pbsa/qbr_not_bad_at_the_right_level/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The sizzle of meat on the grill, the pop-hiss of beverage cans, the marching bands, the cheering crowds, the referee whistles… and of course the horrified screams of onlookers as that beautiful tower of expectations they’d spent the offseason crafting comes crashing down, leaving no survivors.</p> <p> Its good to be back, baby.</p> <p> Welcome back to another season of Tank Job of the Week.

Remember kids- there’s scant evidence that icing the kicker actually works, but there is plenty that actually using your timeouts to preserve the clock to give you a chance to respond does. </p> <p> Onto this week and despite a surprisingly strong slate of opening week games… we’re actually a bit light on the nominee list, with only six candidates lined up. Still, I think we’ve got a front runner, and another strong contender to boot.</p> <p> <strong><em>NOTE: For ease of counting, please use carats to make your vote, like this: &lt;Team&gt;. Thank you for participating!</em></strong></p> <p> <em>HONORABLE MENTIONS</em><br /> <em>- No, I’m not nominating Texas for coming up 40 yards short in a hostile environment against the defending national champions, but when you have the amount of preseason hype surrounding a player and we get THAT for a performance, eyebrows will be raised.</em><br /> <em>- Instead of continuing to nickel and dime their way up the field that had been working so far, Cincy decided to go for it all on a bomb to the end zone that was promptly picked off to keep the Huskers from another one-score disaster.</em><br /> <em>- Louisiana got punked by Rice 14-12 as a 10-point favorite.</em><br /> <em>- Scott Frost’s return to UCF was nearly as disastrous as his Nebraska tenure, he did manage to come back and nip out Jax State.</em><br /> <em>- I don’t know how “Wake Forest 10, Kennesaw State 9” happens and I don’t want to know but everyone involved should feel ashamed.</em><br /> <em>- Kansas State nearly lost to North Dakota but the Hawks went prevent and Avery Johnson pulled off a last minute touchdown to save the Cats from repeating the post-Ireland horror show we were treated to last year.</em><br /> <em>- Oregon’s mascot did an excellent reenactment of the Rose Bowl by falling on his face, losing his head, and running off the field hiding his face in shame.</em></p> <p>And now, the nominees for Week 1 are... </p> <p><strong>ALABAMA CRIMSON TIDE (lost to Florida State 31-17)</strong><br /> Tide roll into Tallahassee 14-point favorites against a team that won all of two games last year, and leave in shambles after being lucky they only lost by that same 2-TD margin. DeBoer is now just 4-4 when favored by fourteen points or more. On the bright side, he probably won’t be favored by that much too often going forward.</p> <p> <strong>ARMY BLACK KNIGHTS (lost to Tarleton State 30-27)</strong><br /> Despite holding the ball for thirty-six minutes and leading 24-10 late in the third, the Black Knights crumbled down the stretch, allowing the Texans to rally back in the fourth quarter and force overtime when the Knights couldn’t connect with a winning field goal. Their kicking woes struck again in the second overtime, and that was all Tarleton needed to bring home the winner. Not an auspicious start for the defending American champs.</p> <p><strong>BOISE STATE BRONCOS (lost to South Florida 34-7)</strong><br /> Of course Boise entered the season as the strong favorite to repeat as the non-power playoff representative, but that’s gone now thanks to the Bulls rattling off thirty-four consecutive points to leave the Broncos a scattered smear all over Raymond James field. Bonus points to whoever’s supposed to make sure USF wasn’t putting in their backup quarterback at punter, because that fake utterly BROKE them.</p> <p><strong>COLORADO BUFFALOES (lost to Georgia Tech 27-20)</strong><br /> After letting Haynes King run like a greased-up pig through their defense to take the lead with a 45-yard scamper, the Buffs had sixty-seven seconds and two timeouts to respond. They barely made it to midfield, keeping both timeouts in their pocket despite burning over half their time on a single play. What is it about Georgia Tech making their opponents forget basic clock management?</p> <p><strong>MIDDLE TENNESSEE BLUE RAIDERS (lost to Austin Peay 34-14)</strong><br /> Obligatory FCS loss, but YEESH. Every year there seems to be an FBS team that just gets roiled by a lower division opponent, and that is MTSU this year after they managed just a pathetic 153 yards of offense against the Governors and were down 21-10 barely twenty-five minutes in.</p> <p><strong>NORTH CAROLINA TAR HEELS (lost to TCU 48-14)</strong><br /> The most decorated coach in NFL history makes his college debut and bedazzles everyone when the Tar Heels scorch their way down the field to take an early 7-0 lead… and then only manage 141 yards the rest of the way as the Frogs rattle off 41 straight points, including two defensive scores. Turns out football is hard when you don’t have Tom Brady playing for you.</p> <p><strong>UCLA BRUINS (lost to Utah 43-10)</strong><br /> Uh… I think you lost that trade, guys.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/2Pollaski2Furious\"> /u/2Pollaski2Furious </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1n6mobk/tank_job_of_the_week_week_one/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1n6mobk/tank_job_of_the_week_week_one/\">[comments]</a></span>",
